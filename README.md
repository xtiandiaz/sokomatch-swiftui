# Sokomatch – SwiftUI

A goalless, generative, puzzle minigame where the swipe gesture is used to dash the (circle representing the) player, and other entities to be arranged in order to reach the exit of each and every stage.

The project was meant to demostrate `SwiftUI`'s and its declarative syntax capability to even create simple and fluid minigames, without external mixins nor internal dependencies such as `SpriteKit`.

**Runs preferably on iOS 15.4+.**
