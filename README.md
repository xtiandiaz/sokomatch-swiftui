# Sokomatch – SwiftUI

A goalless, generative, puzzle minigame where the swipe gesture is used to dash the (circle representing the) player to reach the exit of each and every stage.

The project was meant to demostrate _SwiftUI_'s and its declarative syntax capability to even create simple and fluid minigames, without external mixins nor internal dependencies such as _SpriteKit_.

**Runs preferably on iOS 15.x and later.**
